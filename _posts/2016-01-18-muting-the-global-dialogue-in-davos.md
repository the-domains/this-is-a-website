description: "The invitation was sent. And then, two weeks later, revoked. The World Economic Forum, which on Wednesday begins its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, brings together political and business leaders to discuss the world's most pressing problems. In years past, Vladimir V. Putin has attended. So has Bill Gates."
