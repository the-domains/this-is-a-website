description: "APPLETON, Wis. - Steven Avery, who was convicted in the 2005 homicide of photographer Teresa Halbach, filed motions Monday for release on bond. The documents were filed with the Wisconsin Court of Appeals and claim that because Avery's property was illegally searched, evidence gathered at the property cannot be used against him."
